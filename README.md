# NinjaCrackV2

v1: https://github.com/ex-ref/NinjaCrack/.<br />
After taking down resource.php, putting it up as resource.php, pushing a new loader with some more anti-debug and vmping it. It still gets cracked.<br />
Isolated from the server once again, should work until next game update.<br />

__Instructions__<br />
> 1: Run NinjaLoginBypassv2.vmp.exe. Make sure you only get one message box. If you get another, try terminating all VMWare processes.<br />
> 2: Make a copy of A2.exe because this retard deletes it for "security reasons"?<br />
> 3: Run the copy, enter whatever license you want (without spaces ofc).<br />
> 4: Driver will fail to load for the first time because, Omen is a clown.<br />
> 5: Re-do steps 1 - 3 and now it should come up with a little message box telling you what to do next =D.
